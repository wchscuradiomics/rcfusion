Two-sample t-tests for significance tests of difference, remove non-discriminative features:
If the p-value for feature i exceeds threshold S, feature i is considered non-discriminative. 

Fisherâ€™s correlation coefficients for analysis of correlation coefficients, remove redundant featurs:
If the correlation coefficient between features i and j exceeds threshold C, and the average correlation coefficient for feature i > the average correlation coefficient for feature j, then remove feature i, else remove feature j.
